### Server-side Rendering
- SSR is a powerful technique where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully formed HTML.

- This contrasts with client-side rendering, where web pages are built on the browser using JavaScript and dynamic data.

- Through this project, you will learn how to implement SSR using Python and Flask, leveraging the Jinja templating engine to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.

### How to test the program 
#### For Task 0:
    - In the terminal
        - cd python-server_side_rendering
        - python3 00-main.py
    - Then check the folder `python-server_side_rendering`, you should see files (each file for each guest)
        output_1.txt

        output_2.txt
        
        output_3.txt
