Requirements:
    Python Scripts:
        All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

        All your files should end with a new line

        The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

        A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

        Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)

        All your files must be executable

        The length of your files will be tested using wc


    Python Test Cases:
        All your files should end with a new line

        All your test files should be inside a folder tests

        All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt), except Task 5

        All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*

        
        A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
